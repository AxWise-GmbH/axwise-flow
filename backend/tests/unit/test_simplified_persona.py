        Interview with Alex, a software engineer:

        "I'm really frustrated with how these pricing algorithms work. It feels like they're constantly trying to trick me based on what device I'm using. I spend way too much time manually checking prices on different browsers just to make sure I'm not getting ripped off."

        "As a junior engineer in San Francisco, every dollar counts. I've developed some pretty sophisticated methods for detecting price discrimination, but it's exhausting. I wish there was a tool that could do this automatically."

        "I love sharing these tricks with my colleagues. There's something satisfying about outsmarting these exploitative systems. But honestly, I'd rather spend my time on actual engineering work instead of playing these games."

        "The worst part is never knowing if you can trust the price you're seeing. Are they showing me the real price, or are they inflating it because they think I can afford more? It makes every online purchase feel like a negotiation."

        "I work remotely most of the time, so I'm always online shopping. Having a reliable way to ensure fair pricing would be a game-changer for my workflow and peace of mind."
